This evening you have been invited to host Strictly and unfortunately the computer that manages the scores has broken.  So you also need to write a simple Clojure program to manage the scores

<hr />

Lets take what we have learned about maps so far and represent the dancing pairs and scores from the BBC TV show, Strictly.

This exercise will challenge how well you understand creating maps, as well as the options to update maps in Clojure.


**Model a dance couple and their first score**

<!-- Using expression evaluation fix to make string appear as a value in klipse -->
<pre><code class="language-klipse" data-eval-context="expr">
{}
</code></pre>


**Model all the dance couples and their scores after the first round**

<!-- Using expression evaluation fix to make string appear as a value in klipse -->
<pre><code class="language-klipse" data-eval-context="expr">

</code></pre>


**Add the second round scores for the first pair of dancers**

<!-- Using expression evaluation fix to make string appear as a value in klipse -->
<pre><code class="language-klipse" data-eval-context="expr">
;; (assoc {} :score "new total")
;; (update )
</code></pre>
