Here are some challenges to see what you have learned so far about Collection types _map_ and _vector_.

Define information about the group you are in using a _map_, using Clojure _keywords_ as the keys of the map and strings or numbers for the values.

Remember that a valid map must have a key and a value as a pair.  You can have multiple key-value pairs in a map.

## Define a team member 

**Create a map to define one member of your study group - including name, age, clojure-skills**

<!-- Using expression evaluation fix to make string appear as a value in klipse -->
<pre><code class="language-klipse">
()
</code></pre>


**Use a map to define your study group's members, where the members can be a vector of maps or have a unique name**

<!-- Using expression evaluation fix to make string appear as a value in klipse -->
<pre><code class="language-klipse">
()
</code></pre>

Once you have completed the exercises, take a look at the [suggested examples](https://gist.github.com/dffe60ca6e2dccb8e2ecd837d3b52da4).
