Welcome to the (Klipse powered) curriculum for ClojureBridge.

This curriculum is suitable for those new to programming and you should work through it at your own pace.

Existing developers may go through this content more quickly or may even just jump to the larger exercises.

~~~klipse
(str "Hello" " " "World")
